Something like mini udemy. Normal register and login using laravel authentication. There is an admin panel where one can add users and roles like author and normal user. Author can add video playlist and or share youtube course link. They can write articles and publish the course playlist. This is just the basic web application I built when I was beginning my adventure in laravel and hence some very rookie coding styles for which i humbly beg apology. If you want me to keep upgrading this library you can obviously reach out to me.

There is a small use of Vuejs.
